# DIP
Digital Image Processing


### Import libraries


### Print the count of faces found


### Draw rectangle around the faces



### Use Gaussian blur 


###  Divide the input image into NxN blocks


###  Extract the ROI ( Region Of Interest)

Region of interest : A region of interest (ROI) is a portion of an image that you want to filter or operate on in some way. You can represent an ROI as a binary mask image. In the mask image, pixels that belong to the ROI are set to 1 and pixels outside the ROI are set to 0 

####### Using NumPy array slicing, compute the mean of the ROI

### Draw a rectangle

With the help of mean RGB values over the ROI in the original image

### Return the pixelated blurred image
